## Sublime Text 3 Configuration

This repo contains the useful (mostly non-generated) files in the `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/` directory. Check `.gitignore` to see which files I've deemed "useful".

**Sublime Text** is a highly extensible, amazing text editor. Check `Package Control.sublime-settings` to see which packages I've installed.

On OSX, all ST3 configuration is under `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/`, which contains `Packages` and `Installed\ Packages`. Placing all of this config in a Git repo wouldn't make much sense, because most of the files are auto-generated.

However, backing up this directory with Dropbox or Google Drive is nice, because by simply copying it you can get your ST3 setup running on a new machine.
